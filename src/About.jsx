      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student with a
        passion for turning caffeine and chaos into clean, functional web
        applications. I enjoy building fast, responsive, and (hopefully)
        delightful digital experiences.

        As I level up my skills through university and personal projects, my
        long-term goal is to dive deeper into fullstack development and explore
        how AI can enhance both the user experience and the way we build
        software. Whether it's automating the boring stuff or training models to
        act like weird little digital coworkers, Iâ€™m genuinely excited to be
        part of the AI-powered future.
