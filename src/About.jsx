      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a developer who turns caffeine and chaos into clean, functional web
        applications. I enjoy building fast, responsive, and (hopefully)
        delightful digital experiences. While I'm currently leveling up through
        university, my long-term goal is to dive deeper into fullstack
        development and explore how AI can enhance both the user experience and
        the way we build software. Whether it’s automating the boring stuff or
        training models to act like weird little digital coworkers, I’m excited
        to be part of the AI-powered future.
